The things:

--------------------------------

http://www.yesandyes.org/2014/03/make-the-world-a-better-place.html

-Wipe off the public sink after you use it:
Are you using a paper towel? Why not wipe down the sink after you’ve dried your hands? Public bathrooms frequently go hours between cleanings and I’m sure the next person will appreciate the lack of splashed water and soap scum.

-Return shopping carts to the corral
Last year, my car incurred a $200 scratch thanks to a windy day and one errant shopping cart. And isn’t it insanely annoying when you turn into what looks like an empty parking spot, only be confronted with one very smug and misplaced shopping cart?

-Save your recyclable trash
If you’re on a road trip, save those plastic bottles and aluminum cans till you get find someplace to recycle them.

- If you see some (not totally disgusting) trash, pick it up
I’m not suggesting you peel hamburger wrappers off the street, but if you see an empty plastic bag blowing around or a cleanish plastic bottle – pick it up and deal with it accordingly. Nearly 6.5 million tons (!) of litter and garbage end up in the ocean each year.

- When someone’s good at their job, praise them to their supervisor
This is one of my absolute favorite things. It takes five minutes and it’ll make three days better – yours, the employee, and the supervisor. Win/win/win!

- Post a thank you note on an event’s Facebook page
If someone took the time to get out of their yoga pants, clean the bathroom, and cook something for you, they totally deserve a thank you. Let’s take a moment between changing our profile photos and stalking exs to write something kind on that Facebook page.

-Make eye contact with and smile at your barista/cashier/parking ramp attendant/wait staff
We’ve probably all worked in the service industry at some point and it’s a million times more enjoyable when customers take the time to say hello and interact.

-Report things that break in your apartment building
Are you guilty of doing that thing where you assume someone else has said something? And then you get all annoyed because clearly the management is incompetent? Me, too. 90% of the time when I call my building manager to tell him that the washing machine’s been unbalanced for a week, it’s the first he’s heard of it.

- Report potholes, abandoned cars, etc to the city
The same as above. We all assume someone else is going to do it, but let’s make a pact to be the person who really, actually does something. Most cities have a super easy form on their website for reporting things like this.

- Move to the right when driving slowly
So many fewer middle fingers!

- Offer directions to people who look lost
If someone is wrinkling their brow, looking down at their phone, and then up at the street sign, why not see if you can help?

- Be nice to people who are older than you
Sometimes I have to take deep, calming breaths when I’m in the express line behind someone who is sorting through coupons and paying with a check. But everyone deserves and appreciates kindness and patience. (I repeat to myself, regularly.)

- Put your phone on silent, in your bag when you’re hanging out with someone in person

- When someone on a dating site sends you an email they’ve clearly put time and effort into,  respond (even if you’re not interested) kindly telling them that and wish them luck. (Thanks to my friend Laura for this suggestion.) 
Because haven’t we all experienced that unique heartbreak that comes with slaving over The Perfect Email to someone we’re convinced is our next Someone – only to hear crickets? It’s polite and considerate to acknowledge you got the email, thank them, and wish them the best of luck in their endeavors.

- Hold doors for people pushing strollers or carrying heavy things

- Let people with one or two items go in front of you at the grocery store

- Biggest one: realize that everyone is doing the best they can with what they’ve got (emotionally, professionally, financially, physically) at that moment. If they knew better, they’d do better:
It is so, so easy (so easy!) to get annoyed/disappointed/straight-up pissed off by humanity at large. OMG WHY ARE YOU DRIVING 40 IN THE FAST LANE? Do you think the ’10 item limit’ doesn’t apply to you? Why are you not holding the elevator, ya dick?
But, ultimately, you never know. Maybe they lost their glasses and can’t read the elevator buttons. Maybe they just got dumped and they’re cry-driving. Maybe they’re about to pitch a huge client and they’re too deep in thought to realize they stepped into the express lane. Most of us are doing our best – in whatever shape that takes.

---------------------------

- VOTE!
- Stand up for things you really believe in, even if others don't agree, but don't argue blindly.
- Remain quiet during movies. You're not the only one trying to enjoy yourself.
- Keep yourself well-informed
- When you do something wrong, own up to it and move on. Getting defensive makes it worse. Apologizing and improving is far more respectable.
- Don't talk about others behind their backs. It's okay to vent to friends and family sometimes if someone upsets or annoys you, but it's a different story when you continue to talk down about a person. Whether or not they know what you're saying, you'll be exuding negative energy and there's no need for that.
- Learn about and appreciate other cultures, especially if you don't understand it.
- Learn the proper way to teach children lessons; yelling and being cross with them won't teach them right from wrong. 
- Practice good hygiene.
- When you're eating, turn the tv off.
- Call your parents, family, friends, all those who care for you.
- If you're trying/about to get jiggy wit it, remember that 'NO' MEANS NO. If you don't have consent, back off.
- Donate blood (if you can)
- Don't cheat
- Turn off the lights in a room you're not using.
- Don't keep the water running while you brush your teeth. Keep a cup of water next to you to prevent unnecessarily wasting water.
- Don't litter. Wait for a trash bin or recycling bin. It may be annoying to carry trash around with you but it's much less of an inconvenience than the damage that litter causes.
- Check your privilege.
Understand that there are advantages to being a certain ethnicity, gender, or economic class and learn about the inherent trickery of believing that achievement is solely merit-based. Learn from others; life is meant to be a conversation. 
- Buy recycled paper instead of regular paper. And recycle your used paper.
- Get thick skin. If someone offends you, don't internalize it. People are assholes because of their own personal situations. While that's not a reason for them to be jerks, it's a reason for you to separate yourself from their behavior and not act like a jerk yourself. Be the better person.
- Don't try dull others' shine. Their success does not mean your failure. Be a person who encourages and supports others. Be someone who makes others' feel good.
- Buy from and support small businesses' as much as possible. 
- Plant bee-friendly plants.

- Listen to children as you listen to adults - give them as many rights as you give yourself.
